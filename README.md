This is a template project that uses Nextjs & Typescript, Tailwind + Twin.macro using Styled-components

## I'm still not sure if this uses babel and it opted out of using nextjs's built-in SWC compiler

## But in the terminal, nothing is shown about babel or SWC being disabled

First things first, go change the package.json name to your project name

Then run `pnpm i` to install all the dependencies

Finally run `pnpm run dev` to start the dev server
